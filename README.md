# hello-world
It's me...Just wanting to let the world know I'm here; and wanted to say HELLO.

My Bio

  I'm 42 years old. About 15 years ago made my first website. I liked it but had no formal education. Pretty much me and Google were best friends; figuring things out, or making them work. Now I've decided to start as a beginner and learn EVERYTHING the correct way, so that I may build a flourishing freelance business. With hopes of entering into an actual business and career.
